Wave 3

In this wave we will extend the interactivity with users, allowing them to edit existing tasks.

Edit a task
update each task's show page to include an edit link

this will give the user a new page with a form that is pre-populated with the data about that task
the site should take the user back to the task's show page after the task is updated

Wave 4

In this wave, we will add the ability to delete tasks. We will also add the ability for a user to mark a task complete.

Delete a task
On the task list, add a button or link for each task that will, once clicked:
Ask the user to confirm that they definitely want to delete the task.
Delete the task from the database and redirect the user back to the list of remaining tasks
Mark a task complete
Add a button to the list of tasks on the home page that, when clicked, will mark a task complete
Update the database with the task's completed date
Optional
DRY up your code by reusing the view code from the new functionality
