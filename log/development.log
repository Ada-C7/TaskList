DEPRECATION WARNING: Time columns will become time zone aware in Rails 5.1. This
still causes `String`s to be parsed as if they were in `Time.zone`,
and `Time`s to be converted to `Time.zone`.

To keep the old behavior, you must add the following to your initializer:

    config.active_record.time_zone_aware_types = [:datetime]

To silence this deprecation warning, add the following:

    config.active_record.time_zone_aware_types = [:datetime, :time]
 (called from block (2 levels) in inherited at /Users/sofia/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.4.0@global/gems/activerecord-5.0.2/lib/active_record/attribute_methods/time_zone_conversion.rb:78)

ActionController::UnknownFormat (TasksController#edit is missing a template for this request format and variant.

request.formats: ["text/html"]
request.variant: []

NOTE! For XHR/Ajax or API requests, this action would normally respond with 204 No Content: an empty white screen. Since you're loading it in a web browser, we assume that you expected to actually render a template, not nothing, so we're showing an error to be extra-clear. If you expect 204 No Content, carry on. That's what you'll get from an XHR or API request. Give it a shot.):

DEPRECATION WARNING: Time columns will become time zone aware in Rails 5.1. This
still causes `String`s to be parsed as if they were in `Time.zone`,
and `Time`s to be converted to `Time.zone`.

To keep the old behavior, you must add the following to your initializer:

    config.active_record.time_zone_aware_types = [:datetime]

To silence this deprecation warning, add the following:

    config.active_record.time_zone_aware_types = [:datetime, :time]

DEPRECATION WARNING: Time columns will become time zone aware in Rails 5.1. This
still causes `String`s to be parsed as if they were in `Time.zone`,
and `Time`s to be converted to `Time.zone`.

To keep the old behavior, you must add the following to your initializer:

    config.active_record.time_zone_aware_types = [:datetime]

To silence this deprecation warning, add the following:

    config.active_record.time_zone_aware_types = [:datetime, :time]
 (called from block (2 levels) in inherited at /Users/sofia/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.4.0@global/gems/activerecord-5.0.2/lib/active_record/attribute_methods/time_zone_conversion.rb:78)

DEPRECATION WARNING: Time columns will become time zone aware in Rails 5.1. This
still causes `String`s to be parsed as if they were in `Time.zone`,
and `Time`s to be converted to `Time.zone`.

To keep the old behavior, you must add the following to your initializer:

    config.active_record.time_zone_aware_types = [:datetime]

To silence this deprecation warning, add the following:

    config.active_record.time_zone_aware_types = [:datetime, :time]
 (called from block (2 levels) in inherited at /Users/sofia/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.4.0@global/gems/activerecord-5.0.2/lib/active_record/attribute_methods/time_zone_conversion.rb:78)

DEPRECATION WARNING: Time columns will become time zone aware in Rails 5.1. This
still causes `String`s to be parsed as if they were in `Time.zone`,
and `Time`s to be converted to `Time.zone`.

To keep the old behavior, you must add the following to your initializer:

    config.active_record.time_zone_aware_types = [:datetime]

To silence this deprecation warning, add the following:

    config.active_record.time_zone_aware_types = [:datetime, :time]
 (called from block (2 levels) in inherited at /Users/sofia/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.4.0@global/gems/activerecord-5.0.2/lib/active_record/attribute_methods/time_zone_conversion.rb:78)

DEPRECATION WARNING: Time columns will become time zone aware in Rails 5.1. This
still causes `String`s to be parsed as if they were in `Time.zone`,
and `Time`s to be converted to `Time.zone`.

To keep the old behavior, you must add the following to your initializer:

    config.active_record.time_zone_aware_types = [:datetime]

To silence this deprecation warning, add the following:

    config.active_record.time_zone_aware_types = [:datetime, :time]
 (called from block (2 levels) in inherited at /Users/sofia/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.4.0@global/gems/activerecord-5.0.2/lib/active_record/attribute_methods/time_zone_conversion.rb:78)

DEPRECATION WARNING: Time columns will become time zone aware in Rails 5.1. This
still causes `String`s to be parsed as if they were in `Time.zone`,
and `Time`s to be converted to `Time.zone`.

To keep the old behavior, you must add the following to your initializer:

    config.active_record.time_zone_aware_types = [:datetime]

To silence this deprecation warning, add the following:

    config.active_record.time_zone_aware_types = [:datetime, :time]

DEPRECATION WARNING: Time columns will become time zone aware in Rails 5.1. This
still causes `String`s to be parsed as if they were in `Time.zone`,

To silence this deprecation warning, add the following:
